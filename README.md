# View your github contribution calander in the terminal

I decided to make this in deno, since I figured that dom support would be easy.

```View your github contribution calander in unicode.

Usage:
    gh-cal [--no-colour] [--levels]
    gh-cal [username] [--no-colour] [--levels]
    gh-cal -h | --help```
